 
DOCUMENTATION FOR THE DUAL UPPER BOUND LP ( DUBLP ) PROGRAM.

This program is based on the method of LP given in the appendix to chapter 6 
of your text. The program is written in TURBO PASCAL. 

To run the LP just enter DUBLP and then hit the enter key.

The program asks for three things:

DO YOU WANT DIAGNOSTIC OUTPUT? Y or N  --- To which you respond as you wish. 
With the diagnostics on you get a reprint of the input file and some 
information on which constraints are not yet satisfied as the solution 
progresses.

DO YOU WANT OUTPUT ON THE PRINTER? Y or N -- Answer Y or y to get printer 
output. Note that if you choose diagnostics you will get them on the printer 
also.

ENTER NAME OF INPUT FILE :  -- Here you should enter the disk, directory and 
file name as is normally done with DOS. If the file is in error or 
can't be found a message will appear on the screen and the program will abort.

With or without diagnostics you then get a display of the solution progress 
showing pivot variables. At the end a full variable by variable output appears 
on the screen as well as on the printer if printer output was selected. As 
shown below, the input file allows you to enter a label for each variable 
so that the output is rather self explanatory. NOTE  a limit of 40 iterations 
is built into the LP and if you reach 40 the program will stop.

INPUT FILE FORMAT:

Line 1 and Line 2  - Title lines. May be any ASCII character string up to 80 
characters long each.

Line 3 -- contains two integer numbers separated by a space. The first is 
the number of variables in the problem and the second is the number of 
constraints.

Line 4 -- contains the cost function coefficients. These must be floating 
point numbers( ie they have a decimal point.) and there must be as many of them 
as there are variables. Separate them with a space.

Line 5 -- contains the cost function constant. Often the cost functions are of 
the type   C1(X1) + C2(X2) + ...  

        where C1(X1) = A1 + B1*X1
              C2(X2) = A2 + B2*X2
                     etc.

the cost function for the LP then must consist of:
(A1+A2+...) + B1*X1 + B2*X2 + ...

The first term in this function, ie (A1 + A2 + ...) is placed into line 5 and 
the B1, B2, ... are placed into line 4.


Lines 6,7 ...  -- Contains one line for each constraint. Each line consists of 
a row from the constraint tableau, that is, it contains the constraint 
coefficients for the constraint - one for each variable. This is followed by 
one of the symbols: = < or > to signify the type of constraint.(DO NOT put 
single quotes or double quotes around these symbols.) finally the constraint 
right hand side or limit is entered as a floating point number.

The last group of lines contains the variable limits. Each line contains the 
variable number followed by the variable min and max and then followed by a 
variable label of up to 40 characters long.

The example below shows the file used to solve the fuel scheduling problem in 
example 6E.
