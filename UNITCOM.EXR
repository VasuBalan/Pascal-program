The student cannot possibly carry out the exhaustive calculations for the 
unit commitment problems by hand that can be run by UNITCOM. Therefore it 
gives the student a chance to see first hand how the dynamic programming 
solution is affected by changing the selection of the priority order or 
enumeration scheme and the N and X parameters.

Be aware!! If you constrict the solution too much you will very likely end up 
with no feasible solution. 

For those problems that allow a solution with either complete enumeration and 
priority order try to get a feel for the difference in run time to see why 
enumeration is not a viable alternative even though it may vary well give a 
slightly better solution. Also, for that matter, notice the rather small 
difference in optimum cost from a feasible schedule with one method versus 
another ( ie by choosing different X and N values as well as the choice of 
priority order vs. enumeration ) is the cost savings of the best schedule 
worth the extra effort?

Use the UNITCOM2.DAT file, which has eight units, with complete 
enumeration and let the number of states to be evaluated be 32 for X and 
for N. This will give a very long running solution since 32x32 
transitions are being tried each time period. Compare time and results 
to priority order with only eight states for X and N.
