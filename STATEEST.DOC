

The state estimator is simulated with three programs. 

       1) The loadflow program simulates the power system. To use the state 
          estimator you must first simulate the power system by running 
          the loadflow program. The loadflow program requires reading in 
          the power system network data file and solving for the 
          voltages. To use the state estimator you then must write out the 
          voltage solution data file.( see LOADFLOW.DOC ) 

       2) The scada program ( SCADA ) simulates the Supervisory Control And 
          Data Acquision system. A SCADA system consists of remote terminal 
          units, communication paths, master station units, and a computer 
          system to read data directly from the power system and transmmit 
          and store the measured data into the computer system where it may 
          be acted upon by the state estimator.
           
          In running the scada program the user must enter the power 
          system network data file name, the network voltage solution data 
          file name and the measurement data file name. Last, the user 
          gives the name for the state estimator input file ( see SCADA.DOC ) 

       3) The state estimator program (SE ) reads the state estimator input 
          file created by the scada program and allows the user to run the 
          state estimation algorithm, make printouts and alter input data. 
          ( see SE.DOC ) 

PROGRAM DIMENSIONS ( Applies to LOADFLOW, SCADA AND SE )
Max number of buses = 25
Max number of branches ( lines or transformers ) = 40
Max number of transformers = 10
Max number of voltage measurements = 25
Max number of angle measurements = 25
Max number of injection measurements ( P +jQ ) = 25
Max number of branch flow measurements ( P + jQ ) = 80
Total number of measurements ( voltage, angle, injection and branch flow) is
limited to 100. This means you cannot have all branches measured at each end, 
plus all injections measured, plus all bus voltages measured. This results 
from a limitation on the size of the data areas available in TURBO PASCAL.

To create useful exercises, you can run the loadflow and scada programs 
and then alter the contents of the state estimator input file to simulate 
bad measurements. All of the files used are ASCII data files and can be 
edited directly.
