STATE ESTIMATOR EXERCISES


PROBLEM 1:

Run SE and tell it to use SE6-1.DAT.

1) Print the input data
2) Run the estimator solution
3) Print the solution 
4) Add noise ( option 4 )
5) Rerun the solution
6) Print the solution again ( observe the difference)
7) Calculate normalized residuals
8) Print the residuals.
9) set flow meas from bus 1 to bus 2 to 35 MW and -20MVAR by entering option 3
        and entering:  F 1 2 0.35 .01 -.20 .01  then hit enter and then 
        enter Q to quit option 3.
10) Rerun the estimator ( note J )
11) Recalculate the normalized residuals
12) Print the residuals ( Does meas F 1 2 stand out??)

PROBLEM 2:

Run SE and select SE6-2.DAT.  You are now presented with the following 
problem: Not all the measurements in the first case above are available.  Some 
of the measurements are a little bit bad and one of them is VERY BAD.  Find 
all the bad measurements, remove them and print out the solution of the 
network and show what the true loads and generation values were. NOTE when all 
of the bad meas have been found you should get a perfect state estimate ( ie J 
will equal zero ). If you remove too many measurements you get no solution - 
and you must restart. 

This will require repeated state estimator solutions, calculation of normalized 
residuals and then removal of measurements. DO NOT try to correct the bad 
measurements, just remove them.
