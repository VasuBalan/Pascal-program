DOCUMENTATION FOR THE HYDRO PLANT PROBLEM PROGRAM  

The program HYDRO.PAS contains a dynamic programming algorithm to solve 
problem 7.4 in chapter 7 of the text. You are allowed to change much of the 
problem data to see the result on the solution ( see sample run below ). 
HYDRO.EXE contains the executable file.

In addition, two other files on the disk allow an approximate solution of 
problem 7.4 using linear programming. File PR74A.DAT contains the LP data for 
this problem with the steam and hydro plant characteristics represented by 
linear functions. File PR74B.DAT contains LP data for this problem with the 
steam plant characteristic represented by a two segment linear approximation.
To run these files you must use the DUBLP program explained in DUBLP.DOC.

To run the full dynamic programming algorithm the user enters HYDRO
