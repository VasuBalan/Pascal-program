UNIT COMMITMENT DOCUMENTATION

This documentation file describes the unit commitment program contained 
in files UNITCOM.PAS and the executable file UNITCOM.EXE. The user 
specifies several units and their associated data that are important to 
running a unit commitment solution as well as a load curve to be met by those 
units. The options specified at run time allow the user to choose the type of 
unit list ( priority list or complete enumeration ) as well as parameters 
associated with the dynamic programming solution. 

***FILES

UNITCOM.DOC   This file
UNITCOM.PAS   PASCAL source file
UNITCOM.EXE   PASCAL executable file 
UNITCOM0.DAT  Debug test case
UNITCOM1.DAT  Matches example 5E in chapter five of the text
UNITCOM2.DAT  An eight unit test system ( good to show program run time 
              differences between priority and enumeration)
UNITCOM.EXR   Student exercizes with unit commitment

***GENERATION UNIT DATA

The generating unit heat rate curve is represented as a single straight line 
segment curve as shown chapter five of the text. Therefore only the unit's 
low limit, high limit, incremental cost, and no load cost are input. The 
start up cost and fuel cost are also included together with such parameters as 
minimum down and up time and the initial unit status.

***LOAD CURVE DATA

The load curve is specified as a series of constant MW load periods. 
Each load period may be any length in hours as set by the user.
Up to 8 periods of load data may be input.

***INPUT DATA FILE FORMAT

The unit commitment input data file starts with two header lines of up to 80 
characters each. 

This is followed by a line with a single number equal to the number of 
generating units represented.

Each generating unit has exactly four lines of data. The first is a dummy line 
of characters much like the header ( it is ignored by the program and just 
serves as a label in the data file). The second line contains the unit low 
limit in MW, the unit high limit in MW and the unit incremental heat rate in 
Btu/k Wh. The third line contains the unit no load cost in R/h , the 
unit start up cost in R and the unit fuel cost in R/MBtu. The fourth 
line contains three integers: the unit minimum up time in hours, the 
unit minimum down time in hours and the initial unit status in hours 
(positive being hours up and negative being hours down at the start of 
the schedule). 

This is followed by another line with two entries containing the number 
of periods in the load schedule and the length in hours for each period. 
This is followed by a line with MW load values one for each period in 
the schedule.

***PROGRAM MAXIMUM DIMENSIONS

Maximum number of units = 10
Maximum numbers of periods in the schedule = 8
Maximum number of states in dynamic programming search = 256

***USER OPTIONS

The user is first asked to enter the name of the unit commitment data file.

Next the user is asked to select priority order or complete enumeration for 
the solution. NOTE there is only enough storage allocated for 256 states in the 
dynamic programming search routine. This means that up to an eight unit problem 
can have complete enumeration. For more than eight units you are limited to 
priority order.

Next the user is asked for the number of search states in the previous period
( parameter N in figure 5.6 of text ) and the present period ( parameter X in 
fig 5.6 ). These have a great influence on solution speed and whether a 
solution may be reached or not. 

Finally, the user has the option of including or not including minimum up and 
down constraints.

***SAMPLE PROGRAM EXECUTION

UNITCOM  <---- user starts unitcom program 

 DO YOU WANT OUTPUT ON THE PRINTER? (Y OR N): N <--- user selects crt output

ENTER NAME OF INPUT FILE :  UNITCOM1.DAT  <---- user enters data file name

 
 SELECT UNIT ORDER OPTION 
 1 - PRIORITY ORDER 
 2 - COMPLETE ENUMERATION 
 
 ENTER OPTION NUMBER 1  <---- user picks option 1, priority order


 ENTER NUMBER OF SEARCH STATES IN PREVIOUS PERIOD (N) ? 4  <---- user sets N=4

 ENTER NUMBER OF SEARCH STATES IN PRESENT PERIOD (X) ? 4   <---- user sets X=4

 INCLUDE UP/DOWN TIME CONSTRAINTS (Y OR N) :? Y  <---- includes up/down 
                                                       constraints
