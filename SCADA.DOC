           The SCADA program simulates the functions performed by an on 
      line Supervisory Control And Data Acquision system. The idea is to 
      simulate the power system network, calculate all the voltages, P and 
      Q flows, P and Q injections, etc. on the system and then associate 
      these quantities with a specification of where measurements are 
      being made on the system.

           The power system network is simulated by reading into SCADA the 
      same network data file read into the loadflow program. This file 
      specifies the network topology and the impedances of the branches.
      The net P and Q injection specifications on the file are not used 
      by SCADA. You also need to read in the voltage solution file 
      produced by the loadflow. By specifying the voltage at each bus 
      SCADA can calculate the net injection at each bus as well as the 
      power flowing at each end of each branch of the network.

           To complete the SCADA simulation we need a file that specifies 
      where each measurement is located and how good that measurement is 
      considered as reflected by specifying its standard deviation 
      (sigma). This data is captured in a measurement description data 
      file that looks like the file below: (see file MEAS6-1.DAT on you disk).

         The user must tell SCADA the name of the measurement description data 
      file so it can be read in. The SCADA program now has all necessary 
      information to produce the state estimator input file. This file 
      contains the network topology, impedances and measurement 
      information sufficient to run the state estimator. The measurement 
      data in the state estimator input file has the measurement location 
      in the network along with the measured value from that location and 
      the measurement's sigma values. The user must specify the name given 
      to the state estimator input file.

      A sample run of SCADA is shown below:
From the operating system user enters SCADA and hits ENTER. The user then has 
to enter four file name as described above:

Enter name of load flow data file :SIXBUS.DAT  <-- User entered loadflow data 
                                                   file name

Enter name of solution data file :SOL6-1.DAT <-- User entered file name for 
                                                 loadflow solution voltages

Enter name of measurement data file :MEAS6-1.DAT <-- User entered file name 
                                                     for measurements data.

Enter name of state estimator data file :SE6-1.DAT <-- User entered name of 
                                                       file on which SCADA 
                                                       writes input data for
                                                       state estimator.


           NOTE that the measured values in the state estimator input file 
      are "perfect" values, that is, they equal exactly the voltages, 
      injections and flow values that the load flow calculated. If You run 
      the state estimator on these values directly you should be able to 
      drive the state estimator's residual to virtually zero. However, a 
      real SCADA system will not have perfect measured values. Most of the 
      measured values will be in error by a slight amount ( corresponding 
      to random noise effects, transducer error, etc. ). Some of the 
      measurements will be in error by a large amount and we refer to 
      these as "bad" measurements.

           The measurement errors can be simulated in two ways. Small 
      random errors can be added to the measurements in the state 
      estimator itself ( see SE.DOC ) using a psuedo random noise 
      generator that produces an error proportional to the measurement's 
      sigma. Large random errors can be simulated by outright changes to 
      the measured values either by editing the state estimator input data 
      file or using the editing functions in the SE program itself.
     
      An interesting exercise for you students is to run the loadflow 
      program and SCADA program and then edit the state estimator input 
      data program and ask the students to "find" the bad data using the 
      normalized residual calculation.
