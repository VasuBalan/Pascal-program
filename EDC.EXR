The EDC program is designed to allow students to try problems that will teach 
them about power system operations calculations without burdening them with 
hours of tedious calculations. To effectively use the program you will of 
course need to be able to use a text editor that can operate on unformatted 
ASCII files. Using the text editor you can create your own variations on the 
existing data files as well as create new data files. 

To start you might try changing some of the fuel costs in the EX3A.DAT file to 
see what happens to the resulting dispatch. Similarly you should try changing 
the penalty factors in EDC4.DAT. 

You can experiment with EDC5.DAT to see what happens when you specify a total
generation versus a total load. Note that in the total generation case the 
penalty factors calculated from the loss formula change each iteration while
the total load case has varying losses as well as varying penalty factors to 
contend with.

The EDC3.dat file affords an interesting experiment to see how a lambda search 
routine comes up with a false solution compared to the table lookup solution.

In addition, example 4E and homework problems 3.2, 3.8, and 4.3 can be solved 
using EDC. Note that problem 3.8 will require that you create a third segment 
for the first unit's curve ( I suggest you add the point 300.,9909. between 
the second and third points ). Also note that if you attempt to set up problem
4.3 that the program assumes that the loss formula uses per unit generator
output ( base 100MVA ) so that the numbers in prob 4.3 must be adjusted by
multiplying all the B(I,J) by 1.0E+04 to get the correct losses.
